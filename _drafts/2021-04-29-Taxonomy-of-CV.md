# Preface: different ways to divide up the field of deep-learning based computer vision

Here I'm compiling a growing list of computer vision tasks that I find interesting. The majority of these will harness deep learning in one way or another, so the list is by no means exhaustive.

# Efficiency of training, inference, and model

## Model Compression

# Foundations

## novel loss functions
## novel modules and mathematical operations
## novel regularizers


# Representation Learning

# Image-to-image Translation
- image colorization
- image de-noising, de-hazing, de-raining
- scene transfer??
- attribute modification 
    - face aging, gender change, blonding, etc

# Generative Models
- super resolution/super-sampling
- image inpainting
- style transfer
- view synthesis
- texture synthesis


## Image synthesis
## Video synthesis
### Future video prediction

# Auto-ML/meta-learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, architecture search

# Unsupervised applications
- Deep clustering

# Transfer learning, low-shot learning, zero-shot learning, semi-supervised

# Motion and tracking
## Object tracking
## Visual odometry
## Action recognition

# Image-based 3D reconstruction

> THE goal of image-based 3D reconstruction is to infer the
3D geometry and structure of objects and scenes from one
or multiple 2D images. [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8908779?casa_token=K_gRppORBrIAAAAA:ODSpQVV152L-ijGiadghdKdMON5JEWlwd8nsGxCReaRS51BCUYrC0g9knuTFyMQNGMrayXQi2w)

## 3D shape reconstruction
## photogrammetry; 3D from single image
## stereophotogrammetry; 3D from multi-view and sensors

# Face, gesture, body pose estimation

# Segmentation
## Semantic segmentation
## Instance segmentation

# Object detection/recognition
## shape estimation?
## attribute recognition

# whole-image classification

# Video analysis

# Vision and language
- image captioning
- image synthesis from text

# Adversarial learning and attacks
